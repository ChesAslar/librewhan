1) Replace OrderController::store (fixed auth()->id() and robust)
- done

2) Two API endpoints to power the report page
- done
- done

3) Minimal JS to wire summary + top products into the report page
- done, haven't seen any changes yet since I don't have a database to put datas in, how about let's make a database for it? as well as it supports the functionality you provided to me and connects to inventory

4) PARSE ERROR (Parse error... vendor\psy\psysh...) â€” what happened & how to test safely
- no need to do this
