# Kalibrewhan Cafe - Authentication Setup

## Overview
This Laravel application now has a static authentication system implemented with a login page as the first interaction point.

## Login Credentials
- **Email:** admin@gmail.com
- **Password:** 123

## Features Implemented

### 1. Login Page
- **Location:** `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`
- Modern, responsive design with cafe branding
- Shows demo credentials for easy access
- Form validation with error display
- Remember me functionality

### 2. Authentication Controller
- **Location:** `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php`
- Static authentication with hardcoded credentials
- Session-based authentication
- Redirect to dashboard after successful login
- Logout functionality

### 3. Authentication Middleware
- **Location:** `app/Http/Middleware/StaticAuth.php`
- Protects all dashboard routes
- Redirects unauthorized users to login page
- Registered in `bootstrap/app.php`

### 4. Route Protection
- **Location:** `routes/web.php`
- Root URL (`/`) redirects to login page
- All dashboard routes protected with `static.auth` middleware
- Login/logout routes publicly accessible

### 5. User Interface Updates
- **Location:** `resources/views/layouts/header.blade.php`
- Updated user dropdown to show admin user
- Added working logout button
- Removed dependency on Laravel's default auth system

## How It Works

1. **First Visit:** When users visit the website (`/`), they are shown the login page
2. **Authentication:** Users must enter the correct credentials to access the dashboard
3. **Session Management:** Upon successful login, user session is created
4. **Route Protection:** All dashboard routes check for authentication via middleware
5. **Logout:** Users can logout via the dropdown menu in the header

## Usage Instructions

1. Start your development server (if using Laravel Sail, XAMPP, or similar)
2. Navigate to your local development URL
3. You'll be automatically redirected to the login page
4. Enter the demo credentials:
   - Email: admin@gmail.com
   - Password: 123
5. Click "Sign In" to access the dashboard
6. Use the logout button in the user dropdown to sign out

## Security Note
This implementation uses static credentials and session-based authentication for frontend demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would want to implement proper user authentication with hashed passwords and database storage.
